# ‚ú® Gesture & Voice Control System ‚ú®  

Welcome to the **Gesture & Voice Control System**, an innovative project that lets you control presentations, videos, and even digital art using hand gestures and voice commands.  

This system offers a seamless, interactive experience, eliminating the need for physical interaction with devices. It interprets gestures, executes predefined actions, and responds to voice commands for enhanced usability.
